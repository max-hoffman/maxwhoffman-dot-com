		<p>Waves fell from above,  <br>
		deepening a sea of mud and clay  <br>
		between my mom, brother and me,  <br>
		and the dry warmth of the car.  </p>
		
		<p>I was up to my knees,  <br>
		squishing and plopping my way through the park.  <br>
		Trudging, determined to keep moving,  <br>
		But the car remained out of sight.  </p>
		 
		<p>I glanced at my mom for help,  <br>
		Two dogs in one arm,  <br>
		holding my brother in the other-  <br>
		she's struggling. I go it alone.  </p>
	
		<p>We've been plodding for seventeen years.  <br>
		New dogs replaced those that have passed.  <br>
		40 lbs of children became 400.  <br>
		The car is still out of sight,  <br>
		but our legs grow stronger every day. </p>
