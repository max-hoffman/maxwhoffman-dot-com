			<p> Rosy sheets stack neatly.<br>
			Layer upon layer, we test and bend, <br>
			vibrations of approval responding to every touch. <br>
			humming, waving in our fingers. </p>
			
			<p>The soft shades do not notice, <br>
			our glances towards the prize, <br>
			the real root of our anticipation; <br>
			For we did not come to admire, but to harm. </p>
			
			<p>They relax playfully in our hands. <br> 
			while the knife draws gummy smiles <br>
			whose spring fade into ghostly shadows,<br>
			slower with each second.</p>
			
			<p>Her skin welcomes each puncture, <br>
			but our stroke is clumsy, and the cut spreads beyond our control. <br>
			The separation is delightful,<br>
			but the futility of repair stings worse.</p>
			
			<p>The next will be better, we tell ourselves. <br>
			But our two jagged crests, <br>
			meet at an uncomely point. <br>
			Only perfection will do. </p>
			
			<p>One mistake becomes a dozen, <br>
			and we soon lose ourselves. <br>
			Consumed by the cutting, <br>
			we become as oblivious as the first unscathed form. </p>
			
			<p>One aggressive, careless slice, <br>
			and a new, blacker red emerges. <br>
			The confidence we relied on moments ago, <br>
			now swallows the life we shed. </p>
			
			<p>Her pieces coagulate merlot, <br>
			mocking our intoxicated disregard. <br>
			Playtime is over, for now,  <br>
			but not before weâ€™ve hid the knife for another day. </p>
			
			<p>The lucky learn not to impose or chase<br>
			our conception of beauty,<br>
			but to focus only on the steadiness of our own hand </p>
