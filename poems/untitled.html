		<p> I stand on a clawed wooden floor, <br>
			a haze suspends my focus.  <br>
			My mind is on the cusp of  <br>
			a slicing grey evaporation. <br> </p>
			
		<p> The light, my thoughts,<br>
			impressions on the surface<br>
			Of something agonizingly within reach,<br>
			Out of time.<br> </p>
			
		<p>At our best,<br>
			We scrape and peel the lies<br>
			that grow like sweet dew<br>
			on everything we know.<br> </p>
			
		<p>	When the sirens entrance,<br>
			And soft songs distract,<br>
			The swell rises,<br>
			Drowning what we once were.<br> </p>
			
		<p>	Suffering is the game we play,<br>
			the sacrifice for truth.<br>
			We rage to avoid the deceit<br>
			Of jubilant ignorance.<br> </p>
			
		<p>	"One step, and it will not matter,"<br>
			they say.<br>
			"One step, to peace,<br>
			A new basis."<br> </p>
		
		<p>	One step is too easy, I say.<br> </p>
			
		<p>	The contradiction<br>
			Lies only in your truth,<br>
			Only in the separation.<br>
			"It is too easy," you say.<br>
			That's the point.<br> </p>
