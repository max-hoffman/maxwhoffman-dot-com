			</p> I've spent thousands of hours  <br>
			watching a burning, agonized man,  <br>
			Gifting fire to the world,  <br>
			descending into hell.  </p>
			 
			</p> Every meal,
			the same rubbery chicken.  <br>
			Meat, that regrows in the bowels of frary,  <br>
			to the likeness of prometheus on that rock.  </p>
			
			</p>I drown with salt to dull the char,  <br>
			But the meat is yet cold.  <br>
			The Frary Winds necessitate sweaters and pants,  <br>
			despite my room sweating 100 degrees.  </p>
			
			</p>The man has been castrated  <br>
			by those who found him offensive.  <br>
			Because of the entire 50 foot mural  <br>
			of the suffering man being condemned to hell  <br>
			who I share four meals with a day,  <br>
			His dick was my real concern.  </p>
			
			</p>Half of the world embraced fire,  <br>
			the other scorned the man's sacrifice.  <br>
			Those who refuse to be the crow,  <br>
			inevitably become a feast to gore.  </p>
			
			</p>"Forethought"-  <br>
			who knew the consequences of cleverness,  <br>
			but still chose to sacrifice.  <br>
			I still think half sets the the bar a little high.</p>
