			<p>I run in blackness. <br>
			Rock spurs graze my body. <br>
			I see only shadows,<br>
			but I know the path well. </p>
			
			<p>I am fast, but never fast enough. <br>
			A quiet predator follows,  <br>
			leaping from rock to rock, <br>
			in cadence with the beating of my heart. </p>
			
			<p>I glance behind me, <br>
			and eyeless sockets stare back. <br>
			The most fearsome monsters, <br>
			are the most human. </p>
			
			<p>I don’t know how long I’ve been running,  <br>
			I don’t know what he wants. <br>
			But the faster I become,  <br>
			the stronger he grows. </p>
			
			<p>Some nights he is an armed militia, <br>
			chasing me around the hometowns of my childhood. <br>
			I sprint across lawns, throw myself through bushes, and hide in houses. <br>
			He is always searching, on my tail. </p>
			
			<p>Sometimes he is an assassin in a crowd. <br>
			If I panic and run, I give away my position. <br>
			But if I don’t keep moving, <br>
			a needled dart could steal my breath. </p>
			
			<p>Sometimes I lose. <br>
			I fall off a dark cliff, <br>
			I run into a corner, <br>
			an arrow strikes my leg. <br>
			But I never leave the obsidian. <br>
			The game never ends, not for long. <br>
			He cannot catch me, <br>
			anymore than I can escape myself. </p>
