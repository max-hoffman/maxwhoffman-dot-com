		<p>	Dr. J tosses me a pair of gloves as we run past triage, <br>
			"97, male, Hep C, HIV, multiple organ failure, code blue." <br>
			I stash my tie through my starching and rebutton. </p>
			
		<p>	We push past a swarm of nurses entering the ICU, <br>
			hesitating as we approach the bed. <br>
			a lump of flesh sags in front of the crowd, <br>
			bloated, more sore than skin, expired. </p>
			 
		<p>	Dr. J  grabs the chart: <br>
			"Ex marine," he hesitates, <br>
			 "triple amputee, no friends, no family... <br>
			no DNR." </p>
			
		<p>	There's my queue. <br>
			I lean over a glassy, inert gaze and begin compressions. <br>
			Ribs crunch, flesh oscillates, <br>
			his head thrashes rhythmically under my weight. </p>
			 
		<p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, staying alive," <br>
			the nurse behind me sings. <br>
			"You're going a little too fast, <br>
			follow my tempo." </p>
			
		<p>	Ha - ha - ha - ha - staying alive<br>
			this cold heart might explode in my hands. <br>
			Ha - ha - ha - ha<br>
			for his sake, I almost hope it does. </p>
			
		<p>	I stand back, the lurching subsides. <br>
			"He's one of the lucky ones," a nurse says. <br>
			"Only 15% revive in the same number of minutes." </p>
			
		<p>	It only takes seconds to lose consciousness, <br>
			Minutes before brain loss, <br>
			and we performed CPR for over twenty. <br>
			I took my gloves off, and followed the doctor out. </p>
			 
		<p>	I never learned his name. <br>
			I just hope that before his heart stopped <br>
			for the last time later that night, <br>
			his brain had not been alive to remember meeting me. </p>
