		<header>
		<p> I'm using this area to teach myself how to develop websites and keep track of some of my projects. As I learn CSS and JS, the styling and structuring of this webpage will change drastically; in the meantime, sorry about the amateur setup.  More links will become active as I complete more of the site. Additionally, I'm doing my testing online because moving away from my localhost is making me learn more about managing servers, and I'm not really concerned with getting a whole lot of traffic.</p>
		<p> I'll continue to include some of my research interests and projects, as well as updates for a startup project that I'm developing with a friend. I would write more about the project, but before we have an initial version of the app build, divulging too much information might hinder our work. I've included some poetry I write, for lack of a better place to collect those pieces. In the future, I plan on this area being a space to organize my public professional and personal life. If you have any questions or suggestions feel free ot contact me. </p>
